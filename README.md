# Cat and Dog Detection  

This repository contains a machine learning project designed to detect and classify images of cats and dogs. The project uses deep learning techniques for image classification, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve accurate predictions.  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to differentiate between images of cats and dogs using a trained model. It utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to build, train, and evaluate a CNN on a labeled dataset. The model processes image data, extracts meaningful features, and predicts the class of the input image (cat or dog).  

## Features  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes and normalizes images for better model performance.  
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: A deep learning architecture optimized for image classification tasks.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the dataset with transformations to improve model robustness.  
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Measures the modelâ€™s performance with accuracy metrics.  

## Prerequisites  
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.7+  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/varnika-3004/Cat_And_Dog_Detection.git  
   cd Cat_And_Dog_Detection  
   ```  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

## Dataset  
This project uses a labeled dataset of cat and dog images. You can download a publicly available dataset like the [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). Ensure the dataset is organized into appropriate directories (`train/cats`, `train/dogs`, `test/cats`, `test/dogs`).  

## Usage  
1. **Preprocess the Dataset**  
   - Organize your dataset into training and testing directories.  
   - Run the preprocessing script (if available) to resize and normalize images.  

2. **Train the Model**  
   - Use the provided training script to train the CNN model:  
     ```bash  
     python train_model.py  
     ```  

3. **Test the Model**  
   - Evaluate the model using the test dataset:  
     ```bash  
     python evaluate_model.py  
     ```  

4. **Make Predictions**  
   - Use the trained model to predict new images:  
     ```bash  
     python predict.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg  
     ```  

## Results  
The CNN achieves a high accuracy in detecting cats and dogs. The training and validation accuracy, as well as the loss curves, are visualized in the `results/` directory.
